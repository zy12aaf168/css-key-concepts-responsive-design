## Feline Flexbox - Challenge Mew 🐈

-   Use [CSS flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) to make the cat cards sit next to each other (horizontally) on the page. Three or four across on Desktop should look good. They should then stack on top of each other (wrap) the smaller our screen size gets.

Hint: You'll need to target the parent container for your cat cards with `display: flex;`

Top tip: it can be useful to add temporary borders around your parent and child containers. This will help you identify what's what 👍

-   Don't forget to test how your page looks on different screen sizes using your browser tools!

Note: Flexbox can be challenging, so don't worry if it takes a while to get it right. In fact, learning CSS in general is often an exercise in experimentation to make the page look the way you want.
