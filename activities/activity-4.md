## Media Queries

Ok now our page is looking a little cattier, accessible and responsive! Purrfect. Now let's add some media queries to _really_ spice things up! 💃

### Challenge Paw 🐾

👉 Create a media query for min-width: 700px. Using rem, update our font-sizes so they will be larger for screen sizes with a min-width of 700px.

👉 Create a media query for min-width: 1000px. Using rem, update our font-sizes again, so they will be larger for screen sizes with a min-width of 1000px.

💡 Top Tip: for a nice, visual way to check your media queries are working as expected, change the background colour of your cat page in each media query. Then check your page changes colour at the right break points using your browser inspect tools 🌈

💡 Top Tip: if you're unsure of what font-sizes to use for different width screens (to ensure a good user experience), this [article](https://learnui.design/blog/mobile-desktop-website-font-size-guidelines.html) makes some good suggestions

👉 Using media queries, _hide_ the cat ipsum on mobile

👉 Add a media query that checks what screen preferences a user has. If they prefer dark mode your page should update to dark mode. You can test this by changing your System Preferences.

👉 Remember to test how your page looks by using your developer "inspect" tools and toggling the device view in the tool bar to check your page is responding as expected and looks how you want it to on different screen sizes
